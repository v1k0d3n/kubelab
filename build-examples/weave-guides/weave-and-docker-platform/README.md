This three part tutorial is an introduction to using Weave with the Docker platform. 
Specifically, it describes how to launch a Weave network using three major components of the Docker platform: Machine, Swarm &amp; Compose. After completing all three parts
you will understand the basics of using weave so that you can easily deploy and communicate with your apps within a scalable cluster of Docker hosts.

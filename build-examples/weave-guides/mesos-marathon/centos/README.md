## What You Will Build

Weave provides a software network that is optimized for visualizing and communicating with apps scattered within Docker containers. Using tools and protocols that are familiar to you, Weave provides the network topology that allows you to communicate between containerized apps distributed across multiple networks or hosts more quickly and efficiently.

This example describes how to setup a Weave Network using a cluster manager, specifically, within the Apache Mesos & Marathon environment. For more details on the Apache Mesos and its application manager, Marathon, see the [Apache Mesos Docs](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/) and the [Marathon Docs](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/).

In particular, read about load-balancing in [Weave Run](/run) and the usage of the [Docker API proxy](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/proxy.html) with Mesos.

In this self-contained tutorial, you will:

1. Use Vagrant to install and configure the virtual machines with [CentOS](http://centos.org/).
2. Install and launch [Docker](http://docker.com) and [Weave](http://weave.works) onto the virtual machines
3. Set up and configure [Apache Mesos & Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)
4. Deploy and test a simple web app.

## Let's go!

Before you begin, please ensure the following are installed:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Vagrant & VirtualBox](/guides/about/vagrant.html)

First, clone the repo and then run the vagrant script:

~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/weaveworks/guides
cd mesos-marathon/centos
vagrant up
~~~

Vagrant installed the Virtual Machines `mesos-00` and `mesos-01`. It also configured a single Apache Zookeeper instance that manages `mesos-00` as master, and `mesos-01` as slave within the Marathon framework.

Once `vagrant up` has exited, access the Marathon admin UI through your browser at: `http://172.17.85.100:8080`.

## Viewing the Weave Network on the Virtual Machines

View the Weave network on the virtual machines:

~~~ bash
vagrant ssh mesos-00
~~~

Become root first

~~~ bash
[vagrant@mesos-00 ~]$ sudo -s
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]#
~~~

View Weave status:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# weave status
~~~

or see a more detailed status of weave:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# systemctl status weave
~~~

and then view three Docker containers and Weave:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# docker ps
~~~

Where you should see something similar to this:

    CONTAINER ID    IMAGE                        COMMAND                CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                            NAMES
    b9c179b2303d    weaveworks/weaveexec:1.0.1   "/home/weave/weavepr   4 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes                                                    weaveproxy
    3ca6d9c9dd0d    weaveworks/weave:1.0.1       "/home/weave/weaver    4 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:6783->6783/tcp, 0.0.0.0:6783->6783/udp   weave

There is not much else to do on `mesos-00`, so you can exit:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-00 vagrant]# exit
~~~

Back in your local shell, run:

~~~ bash
./deploy_on_marathon.sh outyet.json
~~~

Where a simple "Hello, World" web app is deployed, as shown in [Marathon tutorial](http://open.mesosphere.com/intro-course/ex17.html).  In this case, 4 instances of the web app are deployed.

This example demonstrates the use of `Weave Run`, a transparent, DNS-based, load-balancer. It also shows how `Weave Net` eliminates the need for port remapping and instead uses a default container port.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you are looking to deploy your own app instead of this example, make sure to <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/0b10b27f0559b8852c12b81b94034823c3816777/mesos-marathon/centos/outyet.json#L12">set the <code>hostname</code> parameter</a>, otherwise your containers will fail to launch.
</div>

Marathon, which can be accessed at `http://172.17.85.100:8080` shows the app deploying and then running:

![Marathon Apps](/guides/images/mesos-marathon/centos/marathon-1.png)
![Marathon Apps - outyet](/guides/images/mesos-marathon/centos/marathon-2.png)

Log on to `mesos-01`, become root and set the environment variable for the Docker API proxy:

~~~ bash
vagrant ssh mesos-01

[vagrant@mesos-01 ~]$ sudo -s
[root@mesos-01 vagrant]# eval $(weave env)
~~~

List the container processes to confirm that there 4 instances of the app:

    [root@mesos-01 vagrant]# docker ps | grep outyet
    
    666a8c7f344e     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.bceb4f07-0ff9-4555-b9f0-99dadc9392fa
    8e708c45d0a9     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.a9db0ff5-f666-40be-bc99-b8ee7dac170d
    819a8c3a4f78     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.05f07ff3-0115-4d4b-b6e7-ce1c9532370e
    d9046f7e63cc     docker.io/goexample/outyet:latest   "/w/w go-wrapper run   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes     8080/tcp     mesos-20150803-095152-1683296684-5050-15616-S0.374e679d-edee-47ed-a3e2-69abf017a3f3

You can now test the app's functionality by creating an interactive container on Weave:

~~~ bash
[root@mesos-01 vagrant]# docker run -ti centos:7
[root@7844aae5d94d /]# curl outyet:8080
~~~

You should see output similar to this:

    <!DOCTYPE html><html><body><center>
            <h2>Is Go 1.4 out yet?</h2>
            <h1>
                    <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/&#43;/go1.4">YES!</a>
            </h1>
    </center></body></html>


Run `curl -v outyet:8080` a few times to confirm that Weave Run has accomplished the load-balancing. You will notice that the IP address for `outyet` is not always the same and instead has been randomized by `Weave Run` as it balances the load amoungst containers. For more information on `weaveDNS` see [Automatic Discovery with WeaveDNS](http://docs.weave.works/weave/latest_release/weavedns.html).

## How Does This Work?

[Weave Net](/net) connects containers on an isolated overlay network, while [Weave Run](/run) provides the DNS and IP address allocation.

Mesos Marathon frameworks implements a management API (used by `deploy_on_marathon.sh` script) and the user interface. Mesos schedules any tasks created through Marathon and runs those on the cluster, where with the exception of `mesos-00` there is a `mesos-slave` service on each of the nodes . Docker and the Weave containers run on all nodes, it doesn't have to run on `mesos-00`, but from a management perspective, it may be convenient to do so. The following diagram illustrates this.

![Architecture Overview](/guides/images/mesos-marathon/centos/diagram-1.png)

To enable Marathon to deploy tasks as Docker containers and to use Weave, there is [a configuration file](https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/0b10b27f0559b8852c12b81b94034823c3816777/mesos-marathon/centos/mesos-slave-containerizers.conf) [installed](https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/0b10b27f0559b8852c12b81b94034823c3816777/mesos-marathon/centos/setup_and_launch_mesos_slave.sh#L7) by Vagrant's provisioning logic which is described below. 

The following diagram shows how Weave interacts with Docker and Mesos.

![Weave Details](/guides/images/mesos-marathon/centos/diagram-2.png)

### How is This Setup?

During the provisioning phase (`vagrant up`), several shell scripts run on Vagrant that install and configure both Weave and any necessary RPM packages from the Mesosphere repository. Open the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/weaveworks/guides/blob/0b10b27f0559b8852c12b81b94034823c3816777/mesos-marathon/centos/Vagrantfile#L59-L82), to see the logic of how, where and when those scripts are executed.

### Overriding Default Configuration Variables

Default variables for this tutorial are specified in the `Vagrantfile`:

~~~ bash
$mesos_slaves = 1
$memory = 1024*2
$cpus = 2
$network = [172, 17, 85]
~~~


Override any of these by creating a `config.rb` file with the desired variables and then saving the file to the same directory.

For example, grow the cluster by running:

~~~ bash
echo '$mesos_slaves = 3' > config.rb
vagrant up mesos-02 mesos-03
~~~

##Conclusions

In this guide, we described how to use Weave with Apache Mesos and its Marathon framework. We configured and installed the infrastructure using Vagrant on CentOS. 

You can easily adapt this example and use it as a template for your own implementation. We would be very happy to hear any of your thoughts or issues via [email](mailto:help@weave.works) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/weaveworks).

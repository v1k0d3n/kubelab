Hi, it’s Ilya from Weaveworks team! Today I am going to show you how easy it is to get started with Weave 1.1 and later versions.

I have two machines here that had just been provisioned with a Linux base image that includes Docker.

Firstly, I am installing Weave using the instructions from the docs — download it into `/usr/local/bin` using `curl` and set the executable permission, same on both machines. Next I will launch all of Weave Net & Run services.

Here I have native host-level DNS provided for me, so I can simply type `weave launch weave-02`, which is the hostname of the second machine. Then I will run, `weave launch weave-01` on the other machine.

Now the Weave cluster is fully connected and I have WeaveDNS for simple container discovery as well as the Docker API proxy, which will allow me to use Docker `run` command directly.

Next, I will need to set `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable, for which there is a command — `weave env`. So I am going to evaluate this in the current shell.

Same on the second machine - `eval $(weave env)`.

Done with the setup, clear the output.

Now I am all set to run some containers!

Here, on the first host I will run a netcat server named “hello“, using plain ubuntu image, really nothing special. The server will listen on port 1234 and will print message to the standard output.

And, on the other host, I want to run an interactive container to test the server. For this I want to use the same ubuntu image...

First,  I’ll ping the server... Great, that worked!

Let's just send it a message across, “Hello, Weave!” — Excellent, this works!

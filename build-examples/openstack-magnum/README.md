# Basic Kubernetes Lab and Various Tests

Here is a DevStack cloud-init configuration file that will allow you to initiate a Magnum release for testing and development within an existing Openstack deployment. My recommendation would be to start at http://www.jinkit.com and read through some of the walkthrough documenation I've provided. I will document more in this repository.

## To Use

Simply follow the instructions on http://www.jinkit.com for building out [your own openstack deployment](http://www.jinkit.com/looking-for-an-invitation-to-the-openstack-party-look-no-further/), make sure it [works correctly with your own environment](http://www.jinkit.com/openstack-for-your-environment/), and then follow the instructions I've provided for using [DevStack in RDO](http://www.jinkit.com/devstack-on-rdo-openstack/). Use this included cloud-init file, rather than the basic example I provided on the walkthrough.

Good luck and happy stacking!
